JARVIM:
Just a rather very intellegent mouse!
What does it do? It makes all "untouchable" PC screens with cameras "touchable"!
Features (on Windows Platform):
    1. Windows command control (closing, minimizing, maximizing, resizing, switching between windows, showing desktop, executing all windows commands including shutdown, etc.)
    2. Cursor control (left/right click, moving around, etc.); possible extension: digital drawing/sketching, FPS games, virtual reality

TODO:
    Currently we use color paiting to recognize gestures. We are going to use two cameras to create a 3D model for the hand in the future.)

Implemented by OpenCV, Python, win32api, Numpy.
